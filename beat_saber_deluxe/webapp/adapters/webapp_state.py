webapp_state.py — tiny persisted settings for the web app (per-machine).

Holds exactly the settings a user would want to survive a server restart and
that must NOT ship with the repo (machine-specific paths): the backup
directory for the Backup/Restore tab. Gitignored (webapp_state.json) — this
is the same treatment ps4_config.json gets.
