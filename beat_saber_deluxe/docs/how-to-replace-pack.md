# How to Replace Every Song in a Song Pack

This guide walks through the end-to-end process of replacing an entire official Beat Saber song pack (e.g., Camellia Music Pack) with custom community songs.

## Prerequisites
- A target song pack on PS4 (e.g., `CUSA12878`).
- Pipeline script (`tools/full_custom_song_pipeline.py`) installed and configured.
- A list of BeatSaver Map IDs for your replacements.

## Required Flags

All song replacements **must** use these flags:
- `--pcm16` — PCM16 FSB5 audio encoding (lossless, required for PS4 compatibility)
- `--no-pad` — Skip 12MB audio padding (PCM16 output is often larger than original)
- `--convert-to-v3` — Convert V2 beatmaps to V3.2.0 format (required for Beat Saber PS4)

Additional flags for pack replacement:
- `--song-name "Name"` — Custom song display name
- `--artist "Artist"` — Custom artist name
- `--deploy` — Upload bundle to PS4 via FTP
- `--generate-config` — Update `redirects.json` with new slot mapping
- `--deploy-config` — Upload updated config to PS4

## End-to-End Workflow

For each song you wish to replace, follow these steps:

### 1. Execute Pipeline for Each Song
Run the pipeline for each song in your target pack. Replace `<MAP_ID>`, `<TargetSlot>`, `<SongName>`, and `<Artist>` with the specific values for your pack.

```bash
# Example for Camellia Pack (Song 1: Crystallized -> Bloom)
python3 tools/full_custom_song_pipeline.py \
    --download-beat-saver-song 12a \
    --target Crystallized \
    --song-name "Bloom" \
    --artist "ODESZA" \
    --pcm16 --no-pad --convert-to-v3 \
    --deploy \
    --generate-config \
    --deploy-config
```

*Note: You only need to run `--generate-config` and `--deploy-config` once if you prefer, but running it every time is safe as it merges into the existing `redirects.json`.*

### 2. Verify Deployment
After the pipeline completes:
1. Ensure the log shows `✅ Redirect config deployed` and `Beatmaps replaced: X/5`.
2. Check the PS4 folder `/data/GoldHEN/AFR/CUSA12878/` via FTP.
3. You should see `{TargetSlot}_v3.bundle` bundles for every replaced song.

### 3. Final Metadata Sync
Once all songs are deployed, perform a final sync of the metadata:
```bash
python3 tools/full_custom_song_pipeline.py \
    --deploy-plugin \
    --enforce-config
```
This ensures your `redirects.json` and `song_metadata.json` are consistent and pushed to the PS4.
